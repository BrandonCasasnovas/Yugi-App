# Yugi-Card-Search-App
This application was made to test YGO's API card database to create a simple card search engine pertaining to all current Yu-Gi-Oh cards available. It is a very bare-bones application that returns only the information you can find on a Yu-Gi-Oh card itself in addition to ban status, ID, etc. I will return to this application to add more features as I flesh them out.

## Installation & Run
Download the zip file and simply run the 'index.html' page in your browser. You must have internet access because the program uses an online API hosted by YGO to access all card information.
